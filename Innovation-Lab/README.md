### Development Local Server Guide

(assuming you're on windows)

In a terminal, use ``cd {path to folder}`` to set the cmd lines location to this folder.

Once you are in this folder, run the command ``npm install`` if you've just downloaded the repo (this will install all the npm packages from the package.json file).

Finally ``npm run dev`` to run the local dev server.

#### then you need to open another terminal to run the flask server
run the python code as usual
(note the python code currently has some defaults in for lat and long, these are the unlimited call lat and long values for the API as to not use the limited number of requests we have)
